# AmazonWebScraper
A web-scraping console application built to scrape the Amazon website (Currently only works with Google Chrome) to search for deals on user-specified items. 
The user is able to filter the search results using the following filters:
1. Filtering by customer ratings (:star: to :star::star::star::star::star:)
2. Displaying today's deals on the item
3. Displaying all discounted search results
4. Specifying the minimum and maximum prices.
